## Stages

1. following from ws_objects1 stage 16:
  * we have a Worm rather than a Tentacle
  * the colours are yellow -> purple to allow use in video with chrome keying




## todo:

* more worms with multitouch
  * as above but with proper z-index drawing on canvas?
  * as above but using DOM not canvas?
* worm head moving around with gyro
* worm hanging down from your finger (gyro)
* anything with geolocation?
  * 1: worm pointing towards buckingham and calculating distance
  * 99: point towards the nearest person to you who's running this app (with web server, web sockets)
